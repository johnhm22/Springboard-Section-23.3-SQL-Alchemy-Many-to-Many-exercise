# Springboard-Section-23.3-SQL-Alchemy-Many-to-Many-exercise
This is one of the coding exercises for students on the Software Engineering course from [Springboard](www.springboard.com)  
It covers the use of SQL Alchemy, Python, Jinja, HTML, and a PostgreSQL database  
It is the third step following on from Parts 1 and 2 and concerns many-to-many relationships by introducing a tags table and a post_tags table; the latter holding post ids and ids of associated tags  
Tags for a user can be viewed, added, edited, deleted  
Posts can be associated with tags  
Tags can be added to and removed from posts  
Routing has been coded in the app.py file to allow all of the functionality  
The objective is to gain experience in coding and connecting these different elements
